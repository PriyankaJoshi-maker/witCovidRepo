				<b><p>1. People aged 65 years and older</p></b>
				<p>Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart and lung disease, kidney disease being treated with dialysis, and diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness</p>
				
				<b><p>Steps to reduce risk of getting sick</p></b>
				<p>There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting sick</p>
				<ul><li>Stay home if possible.</li><li>Wash your hands often.</li><li>Keep space between yourself and others (stay 6 feet away, which is about two arm lengths).</li><li>Check <a href="./precautionaryMeasure.html">Precautionary Measures</a></li></ul>
				
				<b><p>2. Asthma</p></b>
				<p>People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.  COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.</p>
				
				<b><p>Follow your Asthma Action Plan</p></b>
				<p>There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting sick</p>
				<ul><li>Keep your asthma under control by following your asthma action plan.</li><li>Continue your current medications.</li><li>Avoid your asthma triggers</li><li>As more cases of COVID-19 are discovered and our communities take action to combat the spread of disease, it is natural for some people to feel concerned or stressed. Strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack. Take steps to help yourself cope with stress and anxiety.</li><li>Clean and disinfect things and surfaces, you or your family touch frequently</li><li>If possible, have someone who doesn’t have asthma do the cleaning and disinfecting. When they use cleaning and disinfecting products</li></ul>
				
				<b><p>3. Diabetes</p></b>
				<p>Diabetes, including type 1, type 2, or gestational, may put people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. People with diabetes whose blood sugar levels are often higher than their target are more likely to have diabetes related health problems. Those health problems can make it harder to overcome COVID-19.</p>
				
				<b><p>Actions to take</p></b>
				<ul><li>Continue taking your diabetes pills and insulin as usual.</li><li>Test your blood sugar every four hours and keep track of the results.</li><li>Make sure that you have at least a two-week supply of your diabetes pills and insulin</li></ul>
				
				<b><p>4. Chronic Lung Disease</p></b>
					Chronic lung diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
					<p><b>Why you might be at higher risk</b></p>
					<p>Based on data from other viral respiratory infections, COVID-19 might cause flare-ups of chronic lung diseases leading to severe illness.</p>
					<b>Actions to take</b>
				<ul><li>Keep taking your current medications.</li><li>Avoid triggers that make your symptoms worse.</li></ul>
				
				<p><b>5. Obesity</b></p>
					<p>Severe obesity, defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or above, puts people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19.</p>
					<p><b>Why you might be at higher risk</b></p>
					<p>Severe obesity increases the risk of a serious breathing problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major complication of COVID-19 and can cause difficulties with a doctor’s ability to provide respiratory support for seriously ill patients. People living with severe obesity can have multiple serious chronic diseases and underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
					 <p><b>Actions to take</b></p>
					<p>Take your medications for any underlying health conditions exactly as prescribed.</p>

				<p><b>6. Serious heart conditions</b></p>
					<p>Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
					<p><b>Why you might be at higher risk</b></p>
					<p>COVID-19, like other viral illnesses such as the flu, can damage the respiratory system and make it harder for your heart to work. For people with heart failure and other serious heart conditions this can lead to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
					<p><b>Actions to take</b></p>
					<ul><li>Take your medication exactly as prescribed. </li><li>Make sure that you have at least a two-week supply of your heart disease medications (such as those to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure).</li><li>People with hypertension should continue to manage and control their blood pressure and take their medication as directed.</li></ul>

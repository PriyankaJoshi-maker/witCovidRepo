				<p>Leading experts at the FDA say there are no known risks or evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. The more apparent risk with food delivery and takeout is face to face contact with couriers or restaurant staff. There are a few ways you can reduce this risk and still safely enjoy your favorite meals</p>
				<p>With many non-essential businesses closed for the indefinite future, many restaurants have transitioned to delivery only. You can rest easy knowing that eating your favorite meals in the comfort of your own home shouldn't put you at an elevated risk</p>
				<p>Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission. The overwhelming risk comes from being in close proximity to an infected person, especially if they sneeze or cough," he explains. "We also suspect the disease can be transmitted by cross-contamination, i.e. someone sneezes on a surface, you touch that surface with your finger, and then you stick your finger in your nose, and now the virus is in your nose where it can begin to infect you."</p>
				
				<h4>“Contactless” delivery</h4>
				<p>If you're calling a local restaurant to arrange delivery, ask them up front to keep your delivery contactless if possible, simply allowing the courier to leave your meal on your doorstep, front porch, or within your building's lobby.</p>
				<p>The bag the food is delivered in should be your concern, since the virus that causes COVID-19 can reportedly survive for 24 hours on paper or cardboard, as well as 72 hours on plastic.</p>
				<p><ul><li>Place the delivery bag in your sink. Don't let it sit directly on other counter spaces in your kitchen or in the home. You can sanitize or disinfect your sink after the meal is over, and after you've thrown the delivery bag into the trash or recycling, along with any containers</li><li>Plate your food, or transfer it to another clean container in your kitchen. Be sure to avoid touching the food directly; use a clean utensil instead. Don't put any plastic, paper, or cardboard containers in your cupboard or your fridge, as it's unclear if cold temperatures can neutralize the virus currently.</li><li>Wash your hands! You'll need to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before you sit down to eat your meal. At some point, you should also wipe down your sink with a disinfecting wipe</li></ul></p>

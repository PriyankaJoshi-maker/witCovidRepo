App name : Covid Health Ally

This is a website created to burst myths, rumours, half knowledege, garbage knowledege about covid 19 do's and dont's and an initiative to provide all the facts and figures related to covid19. Along with that it will be majorly focusing on vitamins and nutrient intakes to boost imunity.
Since high immunity is the best way to stay safe to fight COVID-19, we have developed a website which will :

1.	Calculate vitamin C, D, A, zinc, carbohydrates and protein in user's daily food intake, 
2.	Suggest food alternates to ensure daily intake is maintained per age/gender demographics. 
3.	Flag high carb to user since low-carb diet is recommended.
 
This is an initiative to provide the audience true and trustworthy source of information.
